# parks-scraper

A work-in progress web scraper that scrapes information from parks canada's website.

Currently, it's able to scrape information based on type (parks, historical sites, marine conservation areas, others), and province.
The information is stored in a PostgreSQL database on my local machine for development purposes, but will be stored in a remote database in the future.

This scraper is part of another project I'm working on. 
It's going to be :fire:.
