# parks-scraper

A work-in progress web scraper that scrapes information from parks canada's website.

Currently, it's able to scrape information based on type (parks, historical sites, marine conservation areas, others), and province. The information is stored in a PostgreSQL database on my local machine as of right now for development purposes, but will be stored in a remote database in the future.

This scraper is small part of a secret, maybe not, project I'm working on.
